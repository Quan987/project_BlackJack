## Game Rules

- Number cards are worth their face value. 
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.
- If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the round.
- If the player and dealer both have the same score, it's a "push" which mean both player are ties!
- Blackjack is achieved with an Ace (11-point) and a 10-point card
